This is the reposity of my course: "Machine Learning Using Scikit-Learn".

Scikit-Learn (sklearn) is a "model-oriented" machine learning toolkit. 
It collects hundreds of machine learning models with a very user-friendly 
API. The users only need to provide very few parameters to control a model 
and sklearn will automatically handle the others. 

Since sklearn is a model-oriented machine learning package, the best way
to learn this package is to learn model by model. Therefore, in the fisrst 
few classes, Iã€€will take everyone to go through all the tutorials provided
by sklearn's official website. After that, we will focus on the basic ideas 
of different models and show how to impelement the model in real examples 
provided by sklearn.

Each lecture would be very short and you should be able to learn one or 
more models in 10 minutes. 

Topics:

1. Introduction to scikit-learn
2. introducion to supervised and unsupervised learning
3. Working with text data
